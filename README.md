## Key Insights & Business Implications

### 1. Model Performance: Decision Tree Wins
| Model          | Accuracy | Why Chosen                                      | Business Value                          |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Decision Tree** | **82.01%** | Higher accuracy + full interpretability       | Explainable AI for regulators & auditors |
| Random Forest  | 81.50%   | Ensemble robustness — but less transparent     | Good for low-stakes, high-volume use    |

> **Risk Manager’s Takeaway**: “Use Decision Tree for high-risk portfolios where model transparency is required. Use Random Forest for batch scoring of low-risk applicants.”

### 2. Counterintuitive Risk Factors: Education ≠ Safety

```plaintext
Pie Chart of Defaulters by Education:
- Graduate: 46.77%
- University: 35.28%
- High School: 16.39%
- Other: 1.56%
```

> **Underwriting Insight**: “Do not assume higher education = lower risk. Our data shows graduate degree holders are the largest default cohort. Re-evaluate scoring weights.”

---

### 3. Gender Imbalance in Default: 60.37% Female

```plaintext
Pie Chart of Defaulters by Gender:
- Female: 60.37%
- Male: 39.63%
```

> **Compliance Alert**: “This disparity requires investigation. Is it behavioral (spending patterns)? Structural (income inequality)? Or data bias? Do not use gender as a feature without fairness audits.”

### 4. Financial Domain Fluency: You Understand the Product

You didn’t just model — you explained:
- **What is a credit card?** Borrowed funds, interest, credit score impact.
- **Types of cards**: Rewards, Store, Secured — each with different risk profiles.
- **Approval criteria**: FICO score, income, credit history — the real-world inputs to your model.
- **Credit vs. Debit**: Borrowed money (credit) vs. your money (debit) — critical for risk context.

> **Product Manager’s Note**: “You can bridge the gap between data science and business stakeholders — a rare and valuable skill.”
